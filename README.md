Image Processing library for RoboCupJunior Soccer robots.

Setup
-----

In our setup we use a RaspberryPi with PS3 webcamera which are both located on
top of our soccer robots. In combination with for instance the serialib library
it can be used as an addon for ordinarily designed robot for the RoboCupJunior
Soccer competition.
